<div class="home">

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, and I am currently a dual-degree(Bachelors+Masters)student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. I am interested and have been doing a fair bit of research in Information Theory, Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computation. I am actually now looking to apply for doctoral positions in these fields for Fall 2022.<br><br>

I just recently made this personal webpage. Here, I maintain a list of my publications and research projects under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. <br><br>

To get a better insight into my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>.  I plan on writing any ideas or thoughts that occur to me on this blog <a href="/blog">here</a> as well. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
